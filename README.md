My solutions to freeCodeCamp projects/problems

## DISCLAIMER
Please do not just copy my solutions if you are doing the freeCodeCamp projects. It defeats the purpose and you won't learn anything.
You can reference my code if you get stuck on the projects, but do your best to work through the projects on your own!
